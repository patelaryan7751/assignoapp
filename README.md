Sometimes mail doesn't reaches to teacher's on time and get queued up and deadline crosses. There is no confirmation of submission of these assignments .There is also problem related with the storage of this pdf and soft copies and its evaluation.
# Solution
Assigno is a web app which could help student in submission of the assignment. There will be notification for the submission of assignment and its confirmation after submission. There is no need for the teacher to store the soft copy as it can be review by them at any time in the webapp. There is another part of this webapp, as the students submits his or her assignment they will be allotted with three other students assignment which the need to evaluate.
